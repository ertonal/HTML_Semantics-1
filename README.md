# HTML_Semantics-1

In this project:
I have added HTML semantic elements (like 'section',
'aside', 'nav', 'header' and replacing them with the div's.)
I have also added alt attributes to my images for accessibility
I have changed html headings to follow a logical order 
I have changed my css styling to match my html classes, so styling doesn't break
I have grouped my class selectors which have the same stylings applied 

This is a screenshot of the finished application:
